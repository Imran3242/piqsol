              <Typography component="p">
              NFT refers to unique non-fungible tokens, which represent pieces of 
                programmable arts in the form of non-fungible ERC721 digital assets that 
                themselves may be created by reference to a smart contract on the 
                Applicable  blockchain. The Platform is an online trading platform where 
                users can sell, purchase, list for auction, make offers, and bid on NFT. You 
                can obtain NFT by making an offer accepted by the seller, purchasing at a list
                price, or bidding on NFT available in smart contract-enabled auctions. You 
                will be able to search, browse, click on links, and purchase NFT that 
                represent the digital Artworks on Platform. A purchaser that becomes an 
                owner of Artwork (“Collector”) will have no intellectual property rights to that
                Artwork.

              <Typography component="p">
              Owning a NFT is similar to owning a piece of physical art. You own a 
                cryptographic token representing the Artist’s creative Artwork as a piece of 
                property, but you do not own the creative Artwork itself. Collectors may show
                off their ownership of collected NFT by displaying and sharing the Underlying
                Artwork, but Collectors do not have any legal ownership, right, or title to any 
                copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights to the underlying
                Artwork, excepting the limited license granted by these Terms to underlying 
                Artwork. The Artist reserves all exclusive copyrights to Artworks underlying 
                NFT on the Platform, including but not limited to the right to reproduce, to 
                prepare derivative works, to display, to perform, and to distribute the

              NFT is optionally offered for immediate acceptance at a List Price established
                by the seller on Platform. You can purchase NFT with a List Price through 
                Platform by sending an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency to a Smart 
                Contract configured to initiate a transfer of the NFT, plus additional fees and 
                gas.

              You can make offers on all listed NFT through Platform. Offers on Platform 
                are legally binding, revocable offers to purchase the NFT capable of 
                immediate acceptance by the seller of the NFT. By making an offer, you 
                agree to temporarily send and lose control over an amount of offered 
                cryptocurrency to a Smart Contract. The Smart Contract is configured to hold
                the offered cryptocurrency until either the offer is accepted by the seller, a 
                higher offer is received, or the offer is revoked. The seller of the NFT has the 
                unilateral authority to accept the bid.

                Platform. You authorize Platform as applicable , to initiate debits in your 
                account in settlement of transactions. You agree to pay Platform any 
                transaction fees for purchase of NFT and authorize Platform to deduct such 
                fees from your account directly. You agree and understand that all fees, 
                commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly 
                through one or more of the Smart Contracts on the Applicable  blockchain 
                network. By transacting on the Platform and by using the Smart Contracts, 
                you hereby acknowledge, consent to, and accept all automated fees, 
                commissions, and royalties for the sale of NFT on the Platform. You hereby 
                consent to and agree to be bound by the Smart Contracts’ execution and 
                distribution of the fees, commissions, and royalties. You hereby waive any 
                entitlement to royalties, commissions, or fees paid to another by operation of

              All transactions on the Platform, including without limitation bidding, listing, 
                offering, purchasing, or confirming, are facilitated by Smart Contracts 
                existing on the Blockchain network. The Blockchain network ie. BSC, Polygon,
                Solana, Ethereum, Avax etc requires the payment of a transaction fee (a 
                “Gas fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the blockchain network, and 
                thus every transaction occurring on Platform. The value of the Gas Fee 
                changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of 
                Platform. You acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract, 
                agreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction on Platform be invalidated, 
                revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas 
                Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise 
                unacceptable to you. You also acknowledge and agree that gas is non-
                refundable under all circumstances.
